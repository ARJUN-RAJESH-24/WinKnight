To create a Windows application, you'll need to move from a console-based program to a project that has a graphical user interface (UI). The README.md for your WinKnight project suggests using WinUI 3 or WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) for this. Since you're new to Visual Studio, WPF is a great place to start as it's a very mature and well-documented framework for building desktop apps.

Here's how to create a new WPF project in Visual Studio:

Step 1: Create a New Project
Open Visual Studio.

On the start screen, click on "Create a new project".

In the search bar, type WPF Application.

From the results, select the "WPF Application" template for C#. Make sure to choose the one for the .NET Framework and not a modern .NET version, as some of your existing code relies on it.

Click "Next".

Step 2: Configure Your Project
Project Name: Name the project something like WinKnightUI. This will be the main application that runs everything.

Location: Set the location to your main WinKnight folder to keep everything organized.

Framework: Make sure the Framework is set to .NET Framework 4.7.2 or higher. This will ensure compatibility with your other console applications.

Click "Create".

Step 3: Understand the UI Files
After the project is created, you'll see two main files:

MainWindow.xaml: This is your UI design file. It uses a markup language called XAML to define what the window, buttons, text, and other visual elements look like. You'll drag and drop controls and edit their properties here.

MainWindow.xaml.cs: This is the "code-behind" file. It's a C# file where you'll write the logic that makes your UI work. This is where you'll put code to handle button clicks and display information.

Step 4: The Integration Plan
Your new WinKnightUI project will be the central hub that runs your other executables.

Call the Executables: Your UI will use C# code to launch SelfHeal.exe, RestoreGuard.exe, and CacheCleaner.exe as background processes.

Read the Output: The UI will read the SelfHeal_report.txt file and other logs generated by your executables.

Interpret and Display: Instead of just showing the raw text from the logs, your UI will interpret the key phrases (e.g., "Corrupted files were found and fixed") and display them in a clean, user-friendly way. For example, a big green message that says "System is healthy!" or a red warning that says "Errors found and repaired."
